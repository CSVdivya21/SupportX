SupportX

What it Does?
---------
SupportX is an innovative Web application that aims to automatically summarize customer-representative conversations into a few key main points, which are stored to convey the substance of the customer's issues to representatives in the future. This is acheieved using the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Due to this customer representatives do not need to start at square one on helping out customers every time a customer calls, streamlining communication for both parties involved. This directly converts to lower costs & higher efficiency for the business, and a smoother & less frustrating support experience for the customer.


How we Built It?
---------
  The main objective of this project is to create a customer service experience by recording the conversation with a customer service representative. This is achieved through the usage of node.js and firebase for the backend development and markup languages for front-end development. In addition, IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding (NLU) API was intelligently used in order to interpret the transcript between the interaction of customer and a representative of the corresponding area of assistance.
  

Challenges and Lessons Learnt:
---------
  We faced issues in setting up the feature extraction from the text, developing a palatable front-end for customer representatives to deal with, & connecting the front-end & back-end together using POST requests. This project taught us how to make our web app more bug resistant & how to enhance the feature extraction from conversational text, which are the hardest parts in our project.
